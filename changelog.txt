- Fix: The wrong town is mentioned in the error when trying to make one way roads of town owned roads [FS#3478] (r18710)
- Fix: Animation buffer for 32bpp-anim blitter was only validated during sprite blitting, other drawing operations did not check it. Initial startup and window resize could therefore lead to crash [FS#3464] (r18709)
- Fix: Enable DrawGroundSpriteAt() to deal with foundations as DrawGroundSprite() does, and use this for drawing one-way-road-signs and clear-land-fences [FS#3467] (r18702)

- Fix: (un)loading counter being reset while loading a train and changing the (path) signal setup around the station [FS#3422] (r18628)
- Fix: {CARGO} takes 2 parameters, not 1. This made {N:XYZ} commands after CARGO mess up their indices and that then triggered an assertion [FS#3425] (r18626)

- Change: Subsidies are not bound to stations after awarding anymore, they still apply to town or industry, no matter what station is used for loading and unloading. Awarded subsidies from older savegames are lost [FS#1134] (r17113)
- Change: [NoAI] Add AIBaseStation as a parentclass for AIStation and AIWaypoint, and move GetName, SetName and GetLocation to AIBaseStation (r17011)

- Fix: Make aircraft behave the same on autoreplace/autorenew as other vehicle types (r18553)
- Fix: First do the time-since-last-service check and only then determine whether autoreplace needs to take place. This way they will not keep autoreplacing continuously on failure, but only after some timeout. Also check some minimal requirements (engine availability, refittability) and a heuristic for the needed money when sending vehicles for autoreplace [FS#1762] (r18551, r18549)
- Fix: Do not account for path reservation costs when entering a signal block via a 'block' signal. This way you won't get double penalties, both red signals and reservation costs, for the block signalled tracks [FS#2722] (r18535)
- Fix: [NewGRF] An industry NewGRF that defined a too small size for action0 prop 0A could cause a crash (r18527)
- Fix: Allegro does not like to work with extmidi, so warn the user about that [FS#3272] (r18520)
- Fix: When you pass a signal at danger, in a PBS controlled area, do not try to do the 'safe' thing and stop, but continue going; the user wanted the train to pass the signal at danger so (s)he has to suffer the consequences. Ofcourse one can always stop the train manually [FS#2891] (r18515)
- Fix: No error message was created for the first fatal NewGRF error [FS#3368] (r18506)
- Fix: Improve airport movement on several airports [FS#3169] (r18505)
- Fix: Autoreplace and autorenew always reset their cargo sub type to 0. Now find a sub cargo type with the exact same name and use that, otherwise fallback to 0. So cargo sub types can be maintained via autoreplace *if* the new vehicle supports the same cargo sub type [FS#3159] (r18499)
- Fix: Cloning of vehicles could create vehicles with invalid cargo sub types for the build year of the vehicle. Fall back to another cargo sub type with the exact same name, otherwise fallback to cargo sub type 0 [FS#2616] (r18498)

- Fix: Use free type ascender/descender metrics to position font offset correctly (r18096)
- Fix: Make the 'pause' chat message when actually executing the pause command. This to prevent showing paused and especially unpaused to be shown when the state does not change. Output now mentions whether pause changes keep the game paused and what reasons for pausing there 'currently' are (r18052)
- Fix: [NoAI] Improve behaviour of (AIEngine|AIEventEnginePreview)::GetCargoType() and AIEngine::CanRefitCargo() wrt. articulated vehicles (r17898)

- Fix: Make the -c <config file> location relative to the current directory instead of the directory of the binary [FS#3247] (r17686)
- Fix: Some semaphore signals fell outside of the signal GUI. Now the signals are properly centered which should make that problem go away [FS#3242] (r17657)
- Fix: Some inconsistencies with the difficulty settings in the scenario editor. Also re-enable changing some difficulty settings (e.g. max loan) in the scenario editor [FS#3219] (r17644)
- Fix: Do not accept cargo produced in the same industry; generalise and improve the check used only for valuables (r17437)
- Fix: Pay only for cargo actually delivered, not for all cargo unloaded at station; can differ with 'stockpiling' industries (r17436)
- Fix: Improve movement of aircraft; do not make turns bigger then 45 degrees while in flight, do not move while turning on the ground (r17415, r17405)
- Fix: Crash in order GUI when changing some orders with both the mouse and keyboard at the exact same time [FS#2859] (r17384)
- Fix: Trains would not show smoke if the load/unload counter was not 0, though there does not seem to be a reason to check that variable anyhow anymore [FS#3162] (r17352)
- Fix: One was not offered to take over bankrupt companies anymore; caused by the introduction NoAI, although NewAI had the same problem too [FS#2769] (r17345)

- Fix: Inconsistency between signs of stations and waypoints [FS#3081] (r17040)
- Fix: NewGRF stations would be triggering assertions for waypoints all over the place when using the more advanced station types [FS#2996] (r16909)
- Fix: Skipping a 'nearest depot order' because none could be found could cause multiple orders to get skipped [FS#2925] (r16457)
- Fix: Makedepend cannot handle the amount of files we have and it also miss some dependencies. So use our custom implementation of makedepend (r16307)
- Fix: Autopause and manual pausing conflict with eachother, new game + pause on new game + autopause make the game not unpause on the first join [FS#2864] (r16242)
- Remove: [NoAI] AIVehicle::SkipToVehicleOrder as it was a duplicate of AIOrder.SkipToOrder (r18504)
- Remove: OPF for RVs and NTP for trains; both the oldest path finders (r18362)
- Remove: Support for gcc2. It has not been able to compile OTTD for months. All attempts to do another workaround failed (r16492)

- Fix: [NewGRF] 'subtract-in' is also signed for production callback version 0 (r17857)
- Fix: [NewGRF] _date_fract runs from 0 to 73 since r2041. Variable 0x09 should not (r17824)
- Fix: Do not fail hard when no soundcard could be detected; just fall back on the null-driver [FS#3268] (r17788)

- Fix: [NewGRF] ActionB should use the online parameters from GRFFile instead of the initial user-specified values from GRFConfig. Also use the values as they were set when the ActionB was executed, not as they are set when the message is shown (r16223)
- Fix: Possible crashes when quiting OpenTTD or forcing resizes/redraws of the screen during map generation [FS#2862] (r16220)

- Fix: 32 bpp sprites in tars would also be shown in the list of heightmaps [FS#2817] (r16023)
- Fix: Sometimes the unregister 'query' thread could be delayed so much that the network stuff was already closed and the packet would never reach the master server causing the server to appear online longer than necessary (r16022)

- Fix: [Windows] Inlined UTF-8 characters (in the source code) are not handled properly on Eastern versions of Windows so escape them (r15762)
- Fix: [Windows] On some system searching a font using its English name fails. So now we search the font using the localised name and use the English name for the final 'validation' only (r15757)

- Fix: Do not try to (un)draw the cursor when the screen is not ready (r15752)
- Fix: The big UFO sometimes landed just outside the map. Instead of landing, just disappear (fly away) in those cases (r15750)

- Fix: Do not crash when the generate map does not contain a suitable location for a town [FS#2720] (r15689)
- Fix: Do not crash when someone substitutes the 'map generation' sprites with garbage [FS#2720] (r15685)
- Fix: Vehicle images would be determined during the process of moving the vehicle which means that only the (orientation) data for the vehicles in front of it is valid. Now the data for the vehicles behind the vehicle are valid too [FS#2546] (r15677)
- Fix: It was possible to remove rail tunnels/bridges and aqueducts build by rival companies [FS#2718] (r15667)
- Fix: Sorting of engines in the purchase list did not use the same numbers as the GUI showed, e.g. articulated parts were not taken into accound when ordering by capacity [FS#2689] (r15666)
- Fix: Handling of aircraft crash counter did not take account of the reduced number of calls (from 6 down to 2) to the aircraft event handler, resulting in crashed aircraft taking three times longer than they should to clear. Compensate by increasing the counter by 3 on every call instead of 1 (r15665)
- Fix: Growing of vsize as (some) threads were not properly released (r15663)

- Change: [NewGRF] To decide whether a vehicle is refittable do not test its current capacity for being zero, but always use the 'capacity property' (r15541)
- Fix: [Squirrel] Almost infinite loop in garbage collection (r15659)
- Fix: Undeterministic file sorting when the date is equal for all files [FS#2716] (r15657)

- Fix: Only ever call any vehicle callbacks after the whole articulated engine has been built (except 0x16) (r15654)
- Fix: C++'s new (this) is seldom a good idea as destructors of member variables are not run causing memory leaks [FS#2706] (r15652)

- Fix: The keep_all_autosave setting was ignored for dedicated servers/spectators [FS#2651] (r15546)
- Fix: If a buoy was placed directly in front of a dock, that dock was seen as a buoy and thus skipped once within 3 tiles [FS#2653] (r15545)
- Fix: Extracting downloaded content did not work for Windows if one uses a non-ASCII path [FS#2650] (r15544)
- Fix: [NewGRF] When articulated parts have no available default cargo, use the cargo type of the first part for livery selection [FS#2617] (r15541)
- Fix: Testing of 'only_this' in CmdRefitRoadVeh() could be skipped by 'continue' (r15540)
- Fix: [NewGRF] If an aircraft cannot carry any available cargo, it should not be available either instead of falling back to passenger/mail. Just like the other vehicle types also do (r15539)
- Fix: Do not allow special sprite characters (e.g. the ship sprite) as characters in input like filenames or text that is sent over the network (r15537)

- Fix: Do not try to find the AIs the server runs when joining a multiplayer server (r15525)
- Fix: Use distance to closest station tile as estimate for YAPF too (NPF already does so). This makes it behave 'better' with wide stations [FS#2631] (r15518)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Wagonoverrides and articulated engine parts use the colour scheme of the engine, but not its recolour callback, nor its 2CC flag. Same applies to roadvehicles [FS#2642] (r15517)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Livery overrides for articulated parts of roadvehicles were not applied (r15516)
- Fix: Make the join/spectate command require to be connected to a network game; in SP it could lead to crashes (r15514)
- Fix: Generating a map with the original map generator with freeform edges on resulted in a crash [FS#2641] (r15511)

- Fix: Crash when opening the game options when the currently loaded base graphics pack has less than 2 valid graphics files. For example when someone replaces all his/her original base graphics with custom work (but keeps the name) or renames the dos ones to windows or vice versa [FS#2630] (r15476)

It should also make it easier to see whether there are updates for NewGRFs and make the necessary updates (r15126)
- Feature: Add support for IP range bans using CIDR notation (r15094)
- Feature: An AI framework so people can write their own AIs. This also removes the old cheating and heavily broken AI (r15027)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Support var 0x45 (curvature info) also for road vehicles (r14945)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Automatically set last engine ageing year to the last 'introduction year plus half model life', to allow engines later than 2050 to appear (r14926)
- Feature: Distant joining of stations (r14919)
- Feature: Advanced setting to keep various building tools active, which are usually closed after placing an object (r14902)
- Feature: Remove the window limit, but leave a configurable limit on the number of non-sticky non-vital windows (r14899)
- Feature: Allow road vehicles to move multiple steps in a tick (code based on train movement code) and add support for RV prop 15. This gives RVs a maximum speed of 318mph instead 79mph. This only implements higher speeds, not 'realistic acceleration' (r14869)
- Feature: Automatic reversing in front of block signals can now be disabled by setting pf.wait_oneway_signal respectively pf.wait_twoway_signal to 255 (r14852)
- Feature: Few (optional) optimisations to making (initial) orders; like keeping goto selected [FS#1984] (r14827)

- Feature: Allow up to 15 companies (r14735)
- Feature: Allow up to 255 clients in multiplayer games (r14730)
- Feature: When the chosen language is not supported by the current font, try to find a font that does and use that instead (r14618)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Action0Industries property 24 (industry supplies default name for nearby station) (r14598)
- Feature: Non-destructive autofill with option to keep waiting times [FS#1124] (r14592)
- Feature: Stop-in-depot order; after this order you have to manually start the vehicle again (or sell it) (r14524)
- Feature: Arrow key scrolling in the server list (r14517)
- Feature: Initial support for handling bidirectional scripts and connecting Arabic characters (r14479)
- Feature: Allow sorting vehicles by remaining life time (r14352)
- Feature: Ability to reset name to default/automatic value (for vehicles, engines, towns, groups, stations, waypoints, managers and companies) (r14334)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add Variational Action 2 Variable 0x47 for houses, Coordinates of the house tile (r14294)
- Feature: Allow overriding the palette of the base GRFs. This way you can play with NewGRFs made for the Windows palette with the DOS palettes base GRFs (and vice versa). Note that for this to work correctly ALL NewGRFs must use the same palette; mix and match is not yet supported (r14229)
- Feature: Double click to join selected server/company (r14209)
- Feature: Allow both the German as well as non-German toyland graphics as 'correct' and official graphics (r14197)
- Feature: Allow people to create their own base graphics easily and without requiring code changes (r14197)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add support for property 0x13 for Bridges. In other words, one can now specifies a 16 bits cost multiplier (r14172)
- Feature: Make it possible to choose between the DOS and Windows graphics packs while retaining the possibility to override the palette (r14151)
- Feature: Increase the size of the console backlog. Now it'll only remove backlog items when there are more than a threshold and when they are there longer than (another) threshold (r14056)
- Feature: Make it possible to filter list_patches output like it's done for other list_* console commands (r14041)
- Feature: Path based signalling (r13926-13967)
- Feature: Show [total-]cargo info in depot when [ctrl-]right-clicking on vehicle (r13923)
- Feature: NewGRF presets, selected by a drop down list in the NewGRF window. Presets are saved in the config file (r13781)
- Feature: Add a few extra columns with information to the server list (r13732)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add var 65 in Variational Action 2 Variables for Houses (r13603)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Implement var 63, variational action2 variable for Houses. Or, in more simple terms, the check for the animation frame of nearby house (r13519)
- Feature: Aqueducts (r13464)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add var 0x69 for industries, long format construction date (r13443)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add long format introduction and maximum construction year for house (r13437)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add access to current long year and date from Action 7/9/D and VarAction2 (23/24 or A3/A4), and add access to (long format) building year, in Variational Action2 Variable 49 for Vehicles (r13376)
- Feature: Splitting of the main toolbar when the resolution becomes very low so the buttons are still visible and useable (r13339)
- Feature: Make news messages use a linked list instead of a moving circular buffer. This makes it possible to store more news messages in the history (r13317)
- Feature: The number of news messages is reduced by removing every news message that is a configurable amount older than when it would not be shown in the newspaper popup/ticker, which is e.g. a month for industry production changes and half a year for subsidy offers. As a result the more important messages will stay longer in the message history (if longer than 30 messages) (r13317)
- Feature: Allow to have more than only two airports per town. The number of airports is now controlled by the noise each of them generates, the distance from town's center and how tolerant the town is (13226)
- Feature: Introducing the so called 'engine pool' which primarily removes the fixed engine type limits and also happens to allow (with the patch option 'dynamic_engines') multiple NewGRF vehicle sets to coexist (r12924)
- Feature: [NewGRF] The ability to play NewGRF sounds for industries and stations (r12817)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add some support for NewGRF station animation (r12798)
- Feature: Sorting vehicle lists by road vehicle/train length (r12766)

- Feature: Ability to send a vehicle (using default orders) to the nearest depot (r12661)
- Feature: Ability to force a vehicle to not load or to not unload at a station (r12650)
- Feature: Four different non-stop types, individually selectable per order. Replaces 'TTDP compatible order' setting (r12648)
- Feature: Three different load type in a single game instead of two. One can choose full load all and full load any instead of full load being governed by the 'full load any' patch setting (r12648)
- Feature: Financial and Player Selection Face windows are now remembering their position when toggling sizes (r12634)
- Feature: Show what cargos a station could be supplied with (r12596)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add random action 2 type 84. For vehicles only (r12452)

- Feature: On Screen Keyboard for input fields so someone without a keyboard can enter text too [FS#1846] (r12425)
- Change: When checking for unique names, compare only with manually set names [FS#1923] (r14958)
- Change: Apply the 'warn if train's income is negative' setting to other vehicle types, too (r14835)
- Change: When loading games in 'network' mode use the start date of the save game for the server and all clients when loading the NewGRFs instead of the current date. Prevents desyncs caused by action 7/9s skipping parts of the GRF based on the date or some other variables that can differ at NewGRF load time (r14769)
- Change: Only say a engine/vehicle is refittable when it can be refitted to at least two cargo type or when it has subcargos (r14683)
- Change: [NewGRF] Since our NewGRF handling is better than it used to be, disable a NewGRF if unexpected sprites are reached (r14184)
- Fix: A town could build a statue under a bridge [FS#2618] (r15397)
- Fix: Multiple vehicles could be filling the timetable and only the data from one vehicle would be taken. Now only allow one to be filling at a time [FS#2466] (r15382)
- Fix: When testing for parallel road two tiles away, do not move more than one tile along the road (r15381)
- Fix: [NewGRF] The subcargo returned by vehicle variable 0x42 should be the most-common-subcargo of the most-common-cargo. If nothing is transported 0x..FFFF00 should be returned (r15378)
- Fix: A tram circling around in a depot did never actually 'enter' the depot [FS#2605] (r15375)
- Fix: Changing town road layout in-game caused ugly road networks [FS#2121] (r15340)
- Fix: Company could never have auto-assigned colour 0 (dark blue) (r15281)
- Fix: Deadlock (with wide fonts) or desync when generating manager name (r15279)
- Fix: Close all windows *before* starting a new game/loading a game instead of doing that as one of the latest steps of loading the game. This caused, in some cases, the NewGRF settings to be reset when the game was already loaded resulting in instant desyncs when joining a network game [FS#2577] (r15256)
- Fix: Aircraft could be 'loading in the air' or have zero speed while in air after converting old savegames [FS#2571] (r15230, r15227)
- Fix: Tile error location not reset when leveling land causing a tile to be highlighted when there was nothing to flatten [FS#2542] (r15138)
- Fix: Signs with sign 'Sign' were lost when converting from TTD savegames (r15137)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Add support for 8 byte action7/9 data, used as a mask for GRFID checks (r15114)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Keep industry variables 8E and 8F in sync with 93, when changing production using results 0D, 0E or 0F of callback 29 or 35 (r15103)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Disable a NewGRF from loading if it contains multiple Action 8s (r14979)
- Fix: Wrong defaults for service interval when switching between service interval in days and service interval in percentages [FS#2508] (r14959)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Building new station parts did not allocate a new station spec effectively breaking variable 41. This was due to the limited number of station specs that we can have per station. This fix makes newly build station parts create a new spec until one cannot allocate new station specs anymore and it'll revert to the old behaviour (sharing station specs) [FS#1832] (r14956)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Station specs did not get deallocated when building a new station part over them (r14955)
- Fix: Sharing/cloning/inserting of orders that the/a vehicle (in the shared list) cannot go to (wrong station type etc) [FS#1890] (r14954)
- Fix: The 'animation state' of the bubbles was stored in a variable that was not stored in the savegame. Using a variable that gets saved in the savegame solves the desync and makes it a bit clearer [FS#2512] (r14931)
- Fix: Abort dragging of vehicles in the group window when they are deleted [FS#2500] (r14925)
- Fix: Do not unnecessarily reset the cursor, when a different vehicle is dragged (r14924)
- Fix: [NewGRF] First create all articulated parts of roadvehicles, then call callback 36 capacity, also call it for all articulated parts (r14903)
- Fix: Overflow of number of orders per vehicle [FS#2495] (r14830)
- Fix: Off-by-one causing possible out-of-bounds reads (r14811)
- Fix: In an MP game in SP mode no company would go bankrupt. Furthermore companies that passed the 'bankrupt' period (4 quarters) would not go bankrupt when loading the game back in MP. Now any company that is in MP or not 'currently controlled by the player' in SP will bankrupt [FS#1993] (r14750)
- Fix: Do not let any disaster vehicle (Helicopter or Airplane) target invalid industry (r14746)
- Fix: Memory leak in Action 0x0F (new town names) (r14737)
- Fix: Writing a single char to the config file caused reading outside a buffer (r14729)
- Fix: First transfer the whole load of a vehicle chain to industries before triggering any processing. This reduces callback usage and resolves critical rounding errors when using input-cargo-multipliers instead of production callbacks [FS#2460] (r14705)
- Fix: Zeppeliner (disaster) should target st->airport_tile, not st->xy (r14694)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Gradual filling graphics were not chosen according to the NewGRF spec [FS#2435] (r14678)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Check sprite size when executing action 6 (r14674)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Property 7 and callback 12 were broken for aircraft. Now callback 12 is properly called also for 'mail'. If the callback is not used, 'mail' uses 1/4 of property 7 (rounded up) [FS#2444] (r14672)
- Fix: Possible stack corruption when reading corrupted sprites [FS#2415] (r14610)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Return the current year as construction year for unfinished houses (r14608)
- Fix: [NewGRF] When callback 1E fails, use the standard random colour (r14605)
- Fix: The company ID is off-by-one with respect to the rest of the GUI in the cheat window [FS#2422] (r14603)
- Fix: The range for kicking/banning clients is based on the maximum number of clients, not the maximum number of companies [FS#2414] (r14588)
- Fix: Allow capacity callbacks (15, 36) to return zero capacity (r14578)
- Fix: Crashes when a NewGRF sends an invalid string [FS#2395] (r14563)
- Fix: Order pool seemed to look full when it was not as it only checked whether it was possible to allocate a new block of pool items instead of checking for free pool items (r14547)
- Fix: Do not deliver cargo to industries not inside station catchment area [FS#2138] (r14530)
- Fix: Allocate stub (empty) sound entries when loading an empty/corrupt/incorrectly sized sample.cat instead of making valid NewGRFs fail to load (r14527)
- Fix: Make sure trains stop at the end of a station; a 3/8th length train did stop 2/8th of it's length too early causing a 63/8th long train not to fit in a 4 tile station [FS#2379] (r14526)
- Fix: Small possible chance of desync due to sorting on pointer instead of by (station) index [FS#2348] (r14463)
- Fix: When a road stop gets moved make sure to update the destination of RVs going to that road stop [FS#2330] (r14446)
- Fix: Support for spaces in directories passed to ./configure [FS#1802] (r14440)
- Fix: Trains would sometimes move one time too often/little when moving from diagonal<->non-diagonal tracks [FS#1793] (r14436)
- Fix: Balance the monthly random industry changes, by introducing a daily random industry change [FS#1885] (r14332)
- Fix: Save the palette of the loaded NewGRFs in the savegame, so joining with a server using Windows palette will make a client with the DOS palette do palette conversion and (thus) not cause a desync (r14233)
- Fix: Glitches (alignment issues/inconsistent vehicle graphics) in original graphics (r14214, r14211)
- Fix: One could not get a list of vehicles sharing an order when the number of orders was 0; you could see that the vehicles had a shared order though [FS#2085] (r14097)
- Fix: Various assorted autoreplace issues/malbehaviours [FS#1264, FS#2037, FS#2038, FS#2110] (r14083)
- Fix: The autoreplace gui showed vehicle types for replacement which CmdSetAutoReplace() did not accept (r14037)
- Fix: Automatically recalculate inflation if NewGRFs are changed and cargo types are added, so that cargo payment rates are correct [FS#2074] (r13836)


0.6.3 (2008-10-01)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: NewGRF VarAction 2 variable 43 for industries saw MP_VOID tiles as land tiles and was inefficient (r14417, r14416, r14415)

- Fix: Multiheaded parts in free wagon chains were not connected (could cause desyncs) (r14366, r14362)
- Fix: [Windows] Some keypress combinations could be handled twice [FS#2206] (r14363)
- Fix: The ownership of roadtiles was not properly set for very old savegames (including TTD's) making it impossible to remove some pieces of road [FS#2311] (r14359)
- Fix: Desync due to randomly ordered vehicle hash by flooding and road vehicle overtake/following (r14356, r14258)
- Fix: Signs were not updated on company bankruptcy/sell, and thus could have the colour of invalid player (r14348)
- Fix: Delete the RenameSignWindow when 'its' sign is deleted (r14345)
- Fix: Signs from old savegames were lost (causing little memory leaks) (r14340)
- Fix: When a company was renamed and then manager was renamed before building anything, company name changed (r14328)
- Fix: When you rename a town before building something and build something near that town your company would be called '<old townname> Transport' [FS#2251] (r14327)
- Fix: Free any blocks that a helicopter may have on an oilrig when the helicopter gets forcefully removed (bankruptcy). For other airports this is not needed as they cannot be used by multiple companies [FS#2241] (r14324)
- Fix: Possible assert when renaming removed waypoint (r14322)
- Fix: Properly delete orders so the pool does not fill up (r14319)
- Fix: Do not allow building road over level crossings and drive-through road stops in the wrong direction; do not allow adding roadtypes to non-drive through road stops; pay for all added road bits [FS#2268] (r14316, r14315, r14314, r14308)
- Fix: Aircraft frozen above oil rig when the next order is invalid [FS#2244] (r14309)
- Fix: [YAPF] Only reserve road slots for multistop when they are really reachable [FS#2294] (r14305)
- Fix: One could be trying to get the station name of a station that is outside of the pool (r14297)
- Fix: Default for sound effects and music volume should be in the valid range for that setting [FS#2286] (r14289)
- Fix: Make small UFO aware of articulated RVs so they crash the complete vehicle instead of a small part of it (r14270)
- Fix: Desyncs after deleting a waypoint because of explicit destructor call instead of using operator delete (r14265)
- Fix: Merge keycode for 'normal' 0-9 keys and keypad 0-9 keys so people do not get confused that the keypad does not work as expected [FS#2277] (r14260)
- Fix: Clicking on the smallmap did not break the 'follow vehicle in main viewport' [FS#2269] (r14243)
- Fix: The engine-purchase-list-sorter doubled running-cost and halfed capacity of double-headed engines [FS#2267] (r14239)
- Fix: Feeder share was computed wrong when splitting cargo packet (r14234)
- Fix: Signs (town name, station name, ...) could be too long for 8bit width in pixels (r14221)
- Fix: 10 days != 6*2.5 days, effectively causing the payment graph to show the wrong data (r14219)
- Fix: When determining length of a string with limited size, first check if we are not out of bounds already (r14204)
- Fix: Properly update the current timetable's travel/wait times instead of only doing it for one vehicle in the shared order chain and only when some bit has not been set [FS#2236] (r14192)
- Fix: Sprite payload skipping would not skip enough bytes in a very small subset of compressed sprites (r14191)
- Fix: After applying NewGRF settings, all rail and road types were available as the engine availability check was performed too early (r14182)
- Fix: Close all related vehicle lists when closing a station window (and not only the train list) (r14180)
- Fix: RemoveOrderFromAllVehicles() did not mark enough windows dirty (r14179)
- Fix: Incorrect cargo weights (r14144)
- Fix: GetSlopeZ() gets a virtual coordinate, not a tile (r14139)
- Fix: Close the 'manage vehicles' dropdown once the number of vehicles in the list reaches 0 [FS#2249] (r14133)
- Fix: [Strgen] Changing order of parameters {X:...} did not work for strings including some {StringY} (r14111)
- Fix: Desync due to bubbles in toyland (r14110)
- Fix: Make NewGRF action 0x06's changes persistent over the several loading stages [FS#1986] (r14102)
- Fix: Make the 'Transfer Credit' display aware of the entire consist, not only the first vehicle (r14098)
- Fix: Do not flood a NewGRF industry when it implicitly tells that it wants to be build on water (land shape flags bit 5) [FS#2230] (r14093)
- Fix: The vehicle window of articulated road vehicles would show the clone/refit button when the vehicle was not completely stopped in the depot (r14090)
- Fix: Flawed parsing of words (as in 2 bytes) in GRF strings due to sign extension [FS#2228] (r14087)
- Fix: Division by 0 in NewAI [FS#2226] (r14062)
- Fix: NewGRF callback 23 did not use the NewGRF compatible text stack [FS#2224] (r14058)
- Fix: NewGRF text stack's 'push word' did not move the data around properly (r14057)
- Fix: Long strings in the edit box would cause OpenTTD to stop drawing the string. This is especially noticable with low resolutions and the chat input box (r14054)
- Fix: [OSX] Changed the condition for selecting 8 or 32 bpp blitter by default. Now we will pick 32 bpp if no 8 bpp fullscreen resolutions are available on the main display (the one with the dock) (r14032)
- Fix: Crash when the AI tries to find the depot of an airport that does not have a depot [FS#2190] (r13999)
- Fix: MSVC cannot handle changed files in the prebuild event, so make the version determination a separate subproject [FS#2004] (r13998)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: Custom vehicle names from TTD(Patch) games were lost (r13884)
- Fix: NewGRF Callback 10 (visual effect and powered wagons setting) and powered wagons operation were not performed for articulated wagons [FS#2167] (r13870)
- Fix: In some cases the sprite cache could be filled with unremovable items [FS#2153] (r13869)

- Fix: Loading of TTD(Patch) savegames from the command line did not work (r13859)
- Fix: Buffer overflow for too long filename supplied as '-g' parameter [CVE-2008-3577] (r13858)
- Fix: Cargo type lookup was incorrect for NewGRF version 7 files without a translation table [FS#2157] (r13855)
- Fix: GetTownByTile() is only valid for houses and roads (r13851)
- Fix: Power, running cost and capacity of multiheaded engines were (too often) doubled in newspaper resp. offer window (r13844)
- Fix: FreeType may return a bitmap glyph even if a grey-scale glyph was requested [FS#2152] (r13832)


0.6.2-RC2 (2008-07-25)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: Building through the wrong side of a drive through station was allowed [FS#2166] (r13822)
- Fix: Check for vehicle length changes outside a depot (callback 0x11) and give a warning about that [FS#2150] (r13816)
- Fix: Several minor memory leaks. They only happened once per game (r13809, 13810)
- Fix: Checking for train waiting at other side of two-way signal was broken [FS#2162] (r13806)
- Fix: Some revision checking code was unintentionally disabled (r13776)
- Fix: Enforce the validity of a NetworkAction (chat packet) issued by a client (r13775)
- Fix: Selecting non-full length vehicles in the depot gui would place the 'mouse pointer' out of the center of the vehicle making it hard to 'aim' [FS#2147] (r13759)
- Fix: NewGRF rail continuation would always mark a tunnel on the same axis as connected, even when the tunnel faces the wrong direction (r13734)
- Fix: Assumption that non-north tiles of a house do not have the 1x1 building bit set was flawed with some NewGRFs. This caused the amount of houses to differ, which causes the town radii to differ, which causes desyncs when towns are expanded (r13729)
- Fix: Possible desync on the autorenew settings 20+ game years (i.e. 4.5+ hours) after a company was started (r13718)
- Fix: Any player could construct new companies [FS#2144] (r13716)
- Fix: Remove the unique_id from the message that a client has joined as it is only exposes the unique_id more than needed (r13714)
- Fix: Possible crash on creating a network packet [CVE-2008-3547] (r13713)
- Fix: Enforce the length restrictions of company and president name in the commands too (r13712)


0.6.2-RC1 (2008-07-16)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: Possible buffer overflow in string truncation code [CVE-2008-3576] (r13700)
- Fix: Handle SETX(Y) properly when truncating a string instead of ignoring it and returning a too long string (r13699)
- Fix: In some cases the (sound) mixer could overflow causing artefacts in the sound [FS#2120] (r13695)

- Feature: Add possibility to show the bounding boxes of sprites using CTRL-B so one can get a better understanding of the used bounding boxes to fix the glitches that still exist. Note that showing the bounding boxes is not glitch free; it only gives you some knowledge where the bounding boxes are (r11174)
- Feature: Remove the arbitrary limit of 10 articulated parts for a vehicle (r11120)
- Feature: Autoslope, changing of slopes of tiles that already have something build on them. Does not work for tiles of houses/industries/stations that do not allow autosloping (r11107)

- Feature: Add the possibility of automatically filling in timetables based on the times from the first (or subsequent) run-throughs (r10331)
- Feature: Option to select the 'default' rail type when you start a new game or load a game.

- Codechange: Make opening a new toolbar not overlapping its parent one, by locating it under the parent, and aligned with the left side of it [FS#1310] (r11256)
- Codechange: Do not brute force determine the first vehicle in the chain or previous vehicle, but do it by properly accounting the previous and first pointers when updating the next pointer. This gives a performance increase of about 15% when there are a lot of vehicles in the game (r11011)
- Codechange: Cache expensive NewGRF station variables during sprite lookups/callbacks (r10509)
- Codechange: Keep track of the origin, time of travel and accumulated feeder share (transfers) of individual pieces of cargo. This means that cargo is not thrown on a big pile when it is put in a station or unloaded at a station, however the GUI does not reflect these changes yet so you will not actually see it (r10266)
- Codechange: Do not limit the cost of tunnels (r10248)
- Codechange: Add new vehicle hash table for collision detection and finding vehicles on a tile. The hash area scanned is far smaller than the old hash table, which is now used for viewport updates only. This should give a significant performance improvement for games with many vehicles (r10111)

- Codechange: Implement actions 1/2/3 for cargoes, callback handler and custom icon sprites (rmany)
- Codechange: Rename the 'New <vehtype>' button of the global vehicle lists to 'Available <vehtype>' as it is a view-only list, not one from which you can purchase (rolling) stock (r8420)
- Codechange: Remove the landscaping button from the build toolbars (r8143)
- Codechange: [NewGRF] Do not mark as unsafe those NewGRFs that set their own parameters (via action D) and/or change only bridge sprite table layouts (action 0, property D) (r7831)
- Fix: The CHANCE16 functions were biased; a 32768 in 65536 chance was really a 32769 in 65536 chance (r11454)
- Fix: Do not create shores in canyons (r11438)
- Fix: Starting OpenTTD with DOS files made it look weird out of the box (r11433)

- Fix: Do not ignore the autorenew settings for new games when creating a new game [FS#1428] (r11415)
- Fix: Do not do a 270 degree turn when 90 degrees is enough on a commuter airport [FS#1422] (r11408)
- Fix: In rare cases OpenTTD could segfault when resizing and scroll the main window (r11405)
- Fix: Manually replacing a vehicle with shared orders makes it lose it is order index and service interval [FS1384] (r11370)
- Fix: Road vehicles must not drive through each other on bridges/in tunnels [FS#1258] (r11366)
- Fix: When stopping a ship or aircraft, set their speed to 0 so they will not continue at the speed where they were stopped at [FS#1288] (r11365)
- Fix: Cloning vehicles with non-standard sub-cargotypes (i.e. livery refits) failed [FS#1380] (r11362)
- Fix: Loading too many GRFs was not handled gracefully causing crashes and such [FS#1377] (r11355)
- Fix: Add missing elrail sprites for some rail build buttons/cursors (r11350)
- Fix: Trees can now be planted on bare land without making it grassy, planting tree in desert does not make it grassy for the first tile-cycle and when a tree dies in desert, it no longer becomes a snowy tile for the first tile-cycle (r11244)
- Fix: The explosion vehicles were placed too far to the south [FS#1312] (r11234)

- Fix: You can now have both Available Train as Available Ship window open [FS#1026] (r10546)
- Fix: Cargo payment rates overflow and cargo payment rates diverge from cost rates making it impossible to make any profit after a certain number of years. Both are solved by stopping the inflation after 170 years; there is absolutely no point in continuing the inflation after that as it only makes the game have overflows at some point that cannot be solved; using larger variables only delays the inevitable [FS#1028] (r10541)
- Fix: Error dialog was sometimes shown on all clients when a command failed instead of only the client that actually did the command [FS#1015] (r10501)
- Fix: The network protocol check for required NewGRFs sent static NewGRFs too (r10414)

- Fix: Flush stdout on dedicated server output to ensure an update of stdout [FS#775] (r10295)

- Fix: If all news-setting buttons show 'full', make the ALL-button show 'full' too (r9137)
- Fix: Open and close messages now have their own setting, so you can hide economy changes, but do show open/close of industries [FS#525] (r9097)
- Fix: Do not make owner signs transparent, as then you loose the information who it owns [FS#637] (r9067)
- Fix: Store the owner of a statue, so when it gets removed, the town is notified of it [FS#638] (r9066)
- Fix: Inactive connections are not automatically kicked, i.e. people who only open a telnet (or similar) connection to a server [FS#115] (r9038)

- Fix: Remove phantom oil rigs sometimes present in old savegames (r8485)
- Fix: When a station is removed, vehicles do not get excessive payment any longer, as the origin TILE is now stored as long as the origin STATION for the transported cargoes (r8144)
- Fix: The game could crash when the chat key (<ENTER>) is pressed too vehemently during the join of the game. Your client's id does not exist in the clients list yet, and returns NULL (r8132)
- Fix: Rail vehicles can no longer enter tunnels or bridgeheads with wrong railtype (r7976)
- Fix: When path finding onto a bridge or tunnel end from previous tile (but not warping from the opposite end) check the enter direction. This fixes signal setting if a rail ends on the top of a tunnel end (r7718)
- Fix: When following path for signals, do not skip back to the previous tile, as for tunnels and bridge ends the entering direction is wrong (r7717)
- Fix: [YAPF] Suppress 'Train is lost' message if path finding ended on the first two-way red signal due to YAPF.rail_firstred_twoway_eol option (r7628)
- Fix: [OPF] Signal update was incorrectly propagated (r7620)

- Fix: Trains would not get flooded when they are at the lower part of a tile that would become a coast tile after flooding [FS#1127] (r10892)
- Fix: Removing road with the road removal tool would also work with a negative bank account, making the bank account even more negative than it was [FS#1125] (r10890)
