openttd (1.0.0~rc3-2) unstable; urgency=low

    The openttd package has been moved from contrib into main. Since the
    OpenGFX free graphics set has been packaged for Debian, one can now run
    OpenTTD without needing any of the resources from the original game
    (though the original resources are still supported).

openttd (0.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Handling of AI players has changed in 0.7.0. This package no longer
    contains any AI players, so playing against the computer is not possible
    out of the box any longer. However, you can easily download AI players
    through the new "Content Downloading Service", after which playing with
    computer players is possible.

    Loading old savegames with computer players is supported (AI players will
    be converted according to the current AI settings), but at this moment
    there are no AIs that completely handle any existing infrastructure built
    by the old AI, so starting a new game might be more fun (especially since
    most of the new AIs are a lot less erratic).
