/**
 * Class that handles all game settings related functions.
 *
 * @note AIGameSettings::IsValid and AIGameSettings::GetValue are functions
 *       that rely on the settings as OpenTTD stores them in savegame and
 *       openttd.cfg. No guarantees can be given on the long term validity,
 *       consistency and stability of the names, values and value ranges.
 *       Using these settings can be dangerous and could cause issues in
 *       future versions. To make sure that a setting still exists in the
 *       current version you have to run AIGameSettings::IsValid before
 *       accessing it.
 *
 * @note The names of the setting for AIGameSettings::IsValid and
 *       AIGameSettings::GetValue are the same ones as those that are shown by
 *       the list_settings command in the in-game console. Settings that are
 *       string based are NOT supported and AIGAmeSettings::IsValid will return
 *       false for them. These settings will not be supported either because
 *       they have no relevance for the AI (default client names, server IPs,
 *       etc.).
