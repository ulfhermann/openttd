 * Additional infos of a tile on a tropic game.

 * The tropiczone is not modified during gameplay. It mainly affects tree growth. (desert tiles are visible though)
 *
 * In randomly generated maps:
 *  TROPICZONE_DESERT: Generated everywhere, if there is neither water nor mountains (TileHeight >= 4) in a certain distance from the tile.
 *  TROPICZONE_RAINFOREST: Genereated everywhere, if there is no desert in a certain distance from the tile.
 *  TROPICZONE_NORMAL: Everywhere else, i.e. between desert and rainforest and on sea (if you clear the water).
 *
 * In scenarios:
 *  TROPICZONE_NORMAL: Default value.
 *  TROPICZONE_DESERT: Placed manually.
 *  TROPICZONE_RAINFOREST: Placed if you plant certain rainforest-trees.
